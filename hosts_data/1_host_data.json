My career was primarily focused on helping communities create thriving and healthy downtowns. Then I began a second career designing fantastic living spaces in many different venues from tropical Maui, urban Seattle, historic properties to beach town and outdoor living Santa Barbara. Acquiring the the historic commercial Mercer building has provided me with the opportunity to open up a beautiful property with its original architecture (wood floors and 12' ceilings) intact for visiting guests. Complete with full kitchens this property is centered in the heart and home of the Washington wine industry where I helped Uncle Don and Aunt Linda plant one of the first wine grape vineyards in 1972. Growing up on a ranch with a large vegetable farm, and coming of age along with the WA wine industry has created a love of cooking and pairing foods with wines. Creating great kitchens, comfy bedrooms and relaxing living spaces is a passion of mine! From Maui to Prosser I've searched for places that provide fresh produce, fruit as well as beautiful wines or great micro breweries. At home in Santa Barbara there are cultural amenities often are only found in large cities. For those like me who love architecture SB is visual delight with a wealth of outdoor activities to keep us busy: hiking, paddleboarding, cycling, walking, tennis, golfing, polo, sailing, kayaking, swimming or just hanging out at the beach or on the patio reading. Sunshine galore but cools off so nice at night! Fantastic music town too - every genre you can imagine, lots of theaters and music venues.. Art and crafts vendors every Sunday at the beach too!","details":["Response rate: 100%","Response time: within an hour"],"medals":["Identity verified","Superhost"],"id":"5aa9934ab82cc4d04c24b54d80630b39d90fb125","gender":"female"},{"firstName":"Carrie","dateJoined":"Joined in November 2011","description":"Superhosts are experienced, highly rated hosts who are committed to providing great stays for guests.","details":["Response rate: 94%","Response time: within a few hours"],"medals":["Identity verified","Superhost"],"id":"6f2df080a6211ec57624c3eea9c3fd50cbe2f321","gender":"female"},{"firstName":"Antonio","dateJoined":"Joined in January 2018","description":"We would love to greet you if possible, otherwise we will leave the studio open for your arrival.

I am a happy resident living in Southern California, which I love. I'm originally from Ohio, attended several universities and received my BA from The Ohio State University, so I AM a huge Buckeye fan, of course! Go Bucks! I had the privilege of traveling to Italy and Spain this past summer for the first time! I enjoyed both of these countries so much, the architect, the ancient history and the ruins mixed with modernism but...Rome simply took my breath away. More about me, I'm a very positive, optimistic and friendly person. I have a sense of humor and I enjoy making people laugh. I also enjoy making people feel at ease, special and loved. I'm also a host of this site and would love to have you as my guest to experience my hospitality in my newly remodeled modern apartment!","details":["Response rate: 100%","Response time: within an hour"],"medals":["Identity verified"],"id":"d9e1a93a36047d461f73401de5d2992a3a7cb461","gender":"female"},{"firstName":"Marilyn","dateJoined":"Joined in August 2014","description":"I am a New Yorker who fell in love with California's weather and decided to stay.
