My career was primarily focused on helping communities create thriving and healthy downtowns. Then I began a second career designing fantastic living spaces in many different venues from tropical Maui, urban Seattle, historic properties to beach town and outdoor living Santa Barbara. Acquiring the the historic commercial Mercer building has provided me with the opportunity to open up a beautiful property with its original architecture (wood floors and 12' ceilings) intact for visiting guests. Complete with full kitchens this property is centered in the heart and home of the Washington wine industry where I helped Uncle Don and Aunt Linda plant one of the first wine grape vineyards in 1972. Growing up on a ranch with a large vegetable farm, and coming of age along with the WA wine industry has created a love of cooking and pairing foods with wines. Creating great kitchens, comfy bedrooms and relaxing living spaces is a passion of mine! From Maui to Prosser I've searched for places that provide fresh produce, fruit as well as beautiful wines or great micro breweries. At home in Santa Barbara there are cultural amenities often are only found in large cities. For those like me who love architecture SB is visual delight with a wealth of outdoor activities to keep us busy: hiking, paddleboarding, cycling, walking, tennis, golfing, polo, sailing, kayaking, swimming or just hanging out at the beach or on the patio reading. Sunshine galore but cools off so nice at night! Fantastic music town too - every genre you can imagine, lots of theaters and music venues..

I enjoyed both of these countries so much, the architect, the ancient history and the ruins mixed with modernism but...Rome simply took my breath away. More about me, I'm a very positive, optimistic and friendly person. I have a sense of humor and I enjoy making people laugh. I also enjoy making people feel at ease, special and loved.

Enjoy the best of both worlds, the laid back vibe of a small beach community that adjoins the thriving city of Los Angeles. You can walk to the beach, 1/2 mile away & LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) 3 miles away! This adorable community has so many restaurants & shops within walking distance. Whatever you need you can find it in El Segundo & in our neighboring cities of Los Angeles, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach & Redondo Beach!\n\nThe space\nMy place is a studio apartment (no bedroom) and great for one person but it can accommodate two. The sofa pulls out into a full size queen bed. SOME guest have found the BED to be too hard or uncomfortable while others have not. It’s not your traditional mattress bed so be forewarned. I have provided a memory foam mattress to sleep on, if you choose. It’s only 180 square feet so if you’re looking to enjoy a cozy modern studio apartment, this is the place for you!\n\nMy place is located in a commercial/residential building on the second floor. My apartment has been totally remodeled and updated. It’s located in a large brick building that doesn't look like an apartment complex from the outside. The interior of the building is well lit, clean and has carpeted hallways. The second floor houses the living spaces of its tenants. My apartment is located on the second floor at the end of the hallway. During the daytime, you may walk through the main entrance: Go up a flight of stairs, turn right, walk to the end of the hall, turn left and my apartment is at the end on the right side, unit #7.\n\nTo access my apartment, follow these instructions: PLEASE use the back entrance behind the building just around the corner and down the alley. If you're facing the front doors at 202 Grand Ave., entrance, walk to the right, walk down the sidewalk until you reach the STOP sign at the alley. Turn left here, walk a few feet (past the dumpsters) and you'll see the staircase to the left. The STAIRCASE leads up to the second floor & the entrance to my apartment. Walk through the doorway & my apartment is the first door on the left #7. AT NIGHT THE FRONT ENTRANCE OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX IS LOCKED AND REQUIRES A KEY, which I don’t give out. Use the back entrance, it’s more convenient. YOU CAN use the front entrance during the day without a key, if you prefer.\n\nMy door will have an ELECTRONIC Key Pad entry, no key. I will give you the entry code before you arrive. Check in is strictly anytime after 3 pm.\n\nABOUT THE KELESS ENTRY:\nYou will get a 4 digit number to enter. NO KEY is needed for the apartment door, but a key is needed to get into the apartment complex after 6 pm.\n\n1. Enter the 4 digit. Turn the latch and push the door in to open. If you mess up just enter code again.\n\n2. The lock will automatically lock after a few seconds, whether opened or closed.\n\n3. When you leave the apartment make sure that the door is locked after you hear it lock.\n\nCHECKOUT: Promptly at 11 am. If you checkout anytime after 11 am you’re agreeing to pay $25 every 15 minutes. So 11:01- 11:15 is $25. 11:16- 11:30 is another $25 equaling $50 and so forth.\n\nEntering through the door you'll find a brand new everything! The living room is small but cozy. It has a wall mounted drop-leaf table and 2 chairs to enjoy a meal or use as a computer station. Two nesting tables with reversible tops sits in front of the 3 sofas/sleeper sectional seats. There is a custom built wardrobe with 2 doors & 6 drawers. There is also a new AC/Heater. The unit on the wall is BOTH AC (air conditioning) & HEATER. For your viewing pleasure you'll find a new mounted 50-inch Samsung 4K Ultra HD Smart TV with HDR Pro, with full motion swivel articulating arms with tilting. Enjoy watching FREE Netflix as you unwind. There is a kitchenette area equipped with cabinets, a stainless steel sink, counter top microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker and mini refrigerator/freezer. The bathroom is to the right of the kitchenette area. It is small and the door, when closed, leaves very little leg room between the door and the toilet, FYI. You will thoroughly enjoy showering with the new Shower Jet Panel System that has 5 shower settings that your body will absolutely love!! The bathroom floor is also made of a waterproof laminate.\n\nPARKING: There is a lot of available free street parking and some with a two hour limit. You can park longer than two hours in the neighborhood on the side streets. There is a parking structure across the street for the $.99 Store and Goodstuff Restaurant that you can use during the day also but no overnight parking. There’s also two parking lots around the corner on Richmond Ave.\nShow more","locationDescription":"I love El Segundo because it's a small seaside community, laid-back with so much character.

Sony Pictures, the old MGM studio location, and Culver Studios is where many movies TV programs have been developed and shot throughout the years. Our neighborhood will soon be the home for Apple's new production headquarters as well as the location of sizable offices of most major tech companies.

We're within walking or biking distance to Venice Beach, Abbot Kinney and the \"Linc\" (a fun new hipster hang out on Lincoln Blvd. in Venice). Our home and garden has been featured in Sunset Magazine, Woman's Day Magazine and the Los Angeles Times Magazine.\n\nThe space\nWhat makes this space unique is that it's tucked away behind a luscious bamboo garden and has it's own private entrance. A sky light and double french doors were added to give the feeling of spacious indoor/outdoor living and to open it up to a dense setting of weeping bamboo, pepper trees and succulents. Keeping with the architecture of the main house, the studio is furnished with clean-lines and 20th-century modern pieces from flea markets and antique stores being careful not to overcrowd the space. Colors in the studio also give it a mid century modern twist. The studio is a converted garage. A mini refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave have been added for the convenience of light cooking. The studio opens up to the outdoor spaces and shared common areas. To create a sense of privacy, the pathway is screened by a California pepper tree, fortnight lilies and succulents. For added privacy, bottom up roller shades can be raised from the bottom to a height that still allows sunlight into the studio.\nShow more","locationDescription":"Quiet and low key.
