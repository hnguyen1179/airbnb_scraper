You are steps from the dog beach and people beach. We took our pup on a walk every morning along a wonderful walkway along the water. You are few minutes walk, drive, or scooter ride away from restaurants, bars, shops, Target, live shows, and more! IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT LOCATION! Check in/out was easy! Loading and unloading the car was easy when parked in the dog beach lot. Backs right up to the patio! Now, for a few downfalls (but the location made many of these forgivable!) There is no place to relax and watch tv except the bed. You can hear everything from the neighbors on all sides. If you have a “high alert “dog or light sleeper-be prepared. This also means bring your earplugs for the planes flying overhead in the morning. Without AC was just fine- we were quite comfortable- but we also went to target the first day and bought a fan to blow on ourselves when sleeping. There was only the fan in the window in the kitchen. Having to keep the windows open at night also meant that the sun lite place up early in the morning. I recommend a sleep mask! The light on the back porch was a flicker light and made it so you couldn’t really see out there once the sun goes down. But the sound of the ocean was so calming! The weekends are VERY busy and parking on the street was more challenging, but it is in such a good spot that it is assumed the beach parking around it would be full! This location can’t be beat, and many these little things were not that big of a concern.

I would have given this place 5 stars but for a couple of things which I will address further down. First, the good - the location is amazing. You are literally right across from the beach and right next to the dog beach. For the price, you really can't beat that. The description and photos were pretty accurate as well. The place was clean upon arrival, and it had everything I needed for the week that I was there. In addition, Natalia responded to any questions I had within a matter of 10 to 20 minutes. I know some people have made comments about the neighbors in the building - I didn't have any issues with them. The ones I encountered were friendly and nice. I think you just have to remember that they live there and the building is their home. Respect that and they will respect you. Also, I did not have any issues finding parking. A couple of times I had to circle, but ultimately found parking nearby.\nThe not so great - the bed. It was beyond uncomfortable and it was probably one of the worst mattresses I have ever slept on. Honestly, if not for the bed I would have given this place 5 stars. I stayed there for a week - if I had only been staying a couple of days, maybe it would have been more tolerable, but by midweek I was actually dreading going to bed at night because it was so uncomfortable. For the price and location, if the mattress was replaced this place would be perfect. The only other negative was that part of the fence in the back was broken. One of the wood panels was broken almost in half, so people in the park can literally see right in to the apartment.\nOverall, it was a good stay. Like I said, the only reason for the 3 stars is because of the bed, which for me is huge when I am staying somewhere for a week.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"60b17e1212b593e9074783a6cbdb2547f2017ac9","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.80"],["Accuracy","4.70"],["Communication","5.00"],["Location","4.80"],["Check-in","5.00"],["Value","4.80"]],"date":"Mon Sep 28 2020 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"We loved this spot!

Had I paid less, this would be a completely different review. \n\nIt absolutely is RIGHT on the beach as advertised, but it should be mentioned that the apartment complex is very run down. I wouldn't say the apartment was dirty necessarily, but some things were definitely grimy- the liquid-stained front door, food-stained artwork above the kitchen sink, the hairs above the shower, the wobbly toilet, the amount of gnats and giant houseflies inside the unit. There arent really amenities- no toiletries aside from a single bottle of body wash, no condiments, and most importantly- no A/C, making our 85°, 90% humidity stay a VERY loud, sticky night. However I did really appreciate the filtering water pitcher and sunscreen!\n\nThere's clearly some weird friction with the neighbors, considering the passive aggressive signs in the cars in the driveway and all the notes around the unit to be quiet, which I don't understand. We were greeted by like three different dogs barking every time we walked in or out, and sitting in the patio or leaving the windows open (a must with no A/C) meant listening to every footstep and word of the upstairs neighbor and hearing every single car, dog, and airplane that passes by starting at 5AM. There are two small fans, one of them broken and only able to face the ceiling, and the other being a window fan, meaning you have to leave the blinds open to use it... Allowing all the neighbors a direct view to the bed.\n\n\nThe biggest redeeming quality would be the location, but ultimately this ended up being a drawback for us due to the noise of massive crowds and dogs in the PACKED beach parking lot (I'm talking like 300+ cars on a random Wednesday) just outside your window and ridiculous lack of parking. That being said, if you are really looking to spend all day at the beach with your dog- this place is probably perfect for you.... Though I personally wouldn't spend the same nightly rate that'd get you a decent hotel room with some privacy, quiet, and air conditioning. \n\nAll that being said, a simple price adjustment or even just a small portable AC unit could easily make this a four star experience. \nShow more"},{"listingId":"60b17e1212b593e9074783a6cbdb2547f2017ac9","scores":[["Cleanliness","5.00"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","5.00"],["Location","5.00"],["Check-in","4.80"],["Value","4.80"]],"date":"Sun Sep 20 2020 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Sparkling clean, newly remodeled but the best part....location, location, location!\nWalking distance to everything OB!!!"},{"listingId":"60b17e1212b593e9074783a6cbdb2547f2017ac9","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.80"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","5.00"],["Location","5.00"],["Check-in","5.00"],["Value","4.80"]],"date":"Sun Sep 27 2020 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Great location right on the beach and a few blocks from awesome restaurants and shops, awesome location for the price the bed however is painfully uncomfortable and beat down and my back ached for days after trying my best to sleep on it all night.

Most homes in the area were built in the 1950’s. This is not an upscale area, and we have priced the space with value in mind. Like a lot of big city neighborhoods in SoCal, it’s a melting pot of folks. You may see people of different shapes, sizes, colors, cultures, ethnicities, orientations, genders, and socioeconomic status.\n\nNoise - Excessive noise has not been a problem. Mornings & evenings, nights are quiet. During the day, you’ll hear street noise from cars & busses passing.\n\nSafety - We feel safe here and so should you! We’ve lived in this neighborhood for 5+ years and have hosted over 250 guests. We have not had any issues with crime, vandalism, or theft. The entire property is fenced & gated and we keep the common areas well lit at night.","stayDescription":"-1. You'll have your privacy, we’re not gonna be in your business, lol 2.

We were up here for a few days, and we loved our time spent in this cabin. If it's available the next time we make the trek up the mountains, we will definitely be booking this same place.\nLet's talk a few details that are relevant to choosing this place by Bearadise.\nLOCATION: It's just a couple minutes from the Stanfield Cutoff. This means you're in a great position to visit either the north or south shores easily. Really close to the Alpine Pedal Path, which runs from the Stanfield Marsh to the Observatory, and is a really nice ride if you get the chance.\nAMENITIES: You're in the mountains! You have the necessities - showers, great beds, cooking pans, and flatware/cutlery. There's not much need for air conditioning. We were there during the hottest days of the summer, and opening the windows at night meant the place was really quite cool. (Yes, a little warm in the heat of the day *upstairs*, but it stayed comfortable downstairs the entire time.) There is also a tv upstairs and downstairs, if that's what you need.\nMANAGEMENT: The entire time of our stay, the owners were very prompt and polite during our conversations. They consistently checked on our stay, and wanted to make sure everything was at its absolute best. With people like this working behind the scenes, you're assured a pleasant stay.\nLike I said, we loved our short stay here, and we hope many others get the opportunity to enjoy it as well. ☺\nShow more"},{"listingId":"e2ad196dbfea8ee2a63aea5ec37652bc6814065c","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.80"],["Accuracy","4.70"],["Communication","4.80"],["Location","4.70"],["Check-in","5.00"],["Value","4.60"]],"date":"Sun Jul 11 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Cozy stay.

The AC stopped working for 5 days in 115 degree weather in Las Vegas in the middle of June. I sent the host a text Saturday night. He got back to me at 8am. At 2pm, I hadn't heard back and informed him that my dog was panting and I informed him that we needed to rent a room because we were too uncomfortable. The AC is wireless and he knew how hot it was in the studio because he was texting me the inside temperature and at one point texting \"What are your thoughts? It's 99F in your room. That is definitely too hot.\" He didn't call me until 9pm on Sunday night to inform me that I should get a hotel room and that he would reimburse me because he couldn't get in touch with his ''AC guy.\" I went to the studio to meet his AC guy on a couple of occasions to let him into the studio so that he didn't have my personal entry door code then I'd receive a message from the host saying that his AC guy was unable to make it. This host wouldn't tell me that I should get another room until I had checked out already, so here I go again, single female with a puppy and carrying all our stuff, alone in Vegas, waiting in another long line to check-in. AC did not get fixed until Thursday afternoon and he's trying to charge me utility fees that went above the $30 per month allotment when ONE, I was out of town from May 26th until June 8th and TWO, the AC was running and only blowing hot air for a week, THREE, you need to run the AC when running the dryer (read below on the dryer situation). After submitting receipts and invoices from the hotel stay, I was reimbursed less than 50% of my hotel costs. I checked out last week and still NO REIMBURSEMENT from this host.\n\nALSO, anyone can rent the house that the studio is attached to and depending on whom it is renting, you can here everything from the main house into the studio. One tenant, parked right in front of the studio door, which made it difficult to get in and out of the studio. Another couple fought so much, we could hear everything. Cops were called on a couple of occasions because the woman had hit the man. My daughter was visiting and I was at work and the cops went to speak to my 17 year old daughter about what she heard. After the cops left, the woman staying there went to the studio to apologize to my 17 year old daughter and told her that she's \"sorry\" for the disturbance and that this man that was staying with her has \"been using\" her for 3 years and that she is \"a sex worker.\" This same couple would smoke weed indoors and it would get into the studio through vents, door cracks. I could lose my career being around that. Other issues: There are no outdoor cameras or alarms as stated on the description. There isn't a stove. Only has a microwave, refrigerator, toaster, 5-cup coffee pot, 2 spoons, 2 forks, 2 plates, 2 bowls, etc. The vent to the dryer exhausts into the bathroom instead of outside like its supposed to so the bathroom gets really hot, so hot that I don't think it's safe and the studio can get warm as well, especially if you leave bathroom door open. TV stopped working because the 3-foot antenna fell on the ground and pulled out the cable input that is in the back of the television and there was no rush to fix it. The host isn't even local. He told me he lives in California and travels to other states as well for work. There is a park across the street with a lot of homeless people who walk up and down the street or hang out at the park. There are also soccer fields at that park, which can get loud too on game nights due to loud music, cars revving and peeling out at the end of the game.\n\nI have documented all communication between me and this host.\nShow more"}]},{"host":{"firstName":"Betsy","dateJoined":"Joined in January 2019","description":"I am here to help with any questions you might have.

Rules was we weren’t allowed outside after 10pm, and got calls saying we were too loud outside when we were already in side. Also the check in was at 3pm and I kept getting calls asking when I was gonna check in and I showed up to check in at 4pmish and when I got there the host was there having the pool cleaned and showing me around but kinda lingered for a while. Was a lot of instructions on checking out as well. But other then that the house is beautiful. Just didn’t like how I felt like we were being monitored at all times."},{"listingId":"0c8e1f7bbaf45e7254235f98ded79b158030d3c4","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.90"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","4.70"],["Check-in","4.70"],["Value","4.80"]],"date":"Wed Apr 21 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Ari & Team #1 ......"},{"listingId":"0c8e1f7bbaf45e7254235f98ded79b158030d3c4","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.70"],["Accuracy","4.70"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","4.90"],["Check-in","4.70"],["Value","4.60"]],"date":"Fri Apr 16 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":""},{"listingId":"0c8e1f7bbaf45e7254235f98ded79b158030d3c4","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.90"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","4.70"],["Check-in","4.90"],["Value","4.80"]],"date":"Wed Apr 28 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"This house is beautiful.

Even from the brief conversation prior to our stay, John was very welcoming. Upon our arrival, John was quick with responding to us with check in instructions. Walking into the Oasis, we were taken away from how big the backyard actually was compared to the pictures. We questioned ourselves to whether or not we actually had access to the whole backyard, there was so much space. The energy walking into the unit was great! So well kept, nice, clean and just so welcoming. The unit also was bigger than we expected from the photos. The pool was calling us every day (not only from the heat but from the beautiful set up). The Koi pond was so relaxing. Sitting on the swinging bench, listening to the waterfall and admiring the decor was an everyday mandatory task by choice. John was great with communicating with us whenever we needed anything. Such great energy.\nWe definitely recommend his unit and we DEFINITELY plan on booking with him again!

Although there's a feeling of isolation, it only takes minutes to drive to town, and is a serene refuge from crowds and traffic. [It's best if you have a car. The nearest bus is about a mile away on a hill] However, quite a few like the walk to town which is about 1/2 hour, and usually take Uber back home.\nYou'll find quiet, privacy, and peaceful living in this beautiful mountain view share.\nNestled in trees, with lots of garden and open space. Good modest room with very basic furnishings, and amenities of house, but bear in mind this is an old house and there are imperfections.The bathroom will probably be shared as I have two available rooms (see Natural Wonders/Privacy and Peace) It's not really possible to reserve one room or the other. Both probably have pluses and minuses! Longer term is usually interesting big wooden bed because it's harder to make and room has more storage space.\nNon-smoking mature guests. No drugs, moderate alcohol, no visitors.\nOne single. Additional persons for $15 each.\nGenerally no children, but child over 10 possible...please inquire\nLow rate for our expensive location and for people who want this special, casual, home atmosphere and don't expect pristine luxury, but value comfort. A month or more will be asked to share in utilities.\nMust like adorable, well, behaved dogs who do not invade your space! A compatible dog might be welcome if there are no other guests, and with extra deposit.\nOff street parking available.\nI offer fruit and goodies first morning.

Complete with full kitchens this property is centered in the heart and home of the Washington wine industry where I helped Uncle Don and Aunt Linda plant one of the first wine grape vineyards in 1972. Growing up on a ranch with a large vegetable farm, and coming of age along with the WA wine industry has created a love of cooking and pairing foods with wines. Creating great kitchens, comfy bedrooms and relaxing living spaces is a passion of mine! From Maui to Prosser I've searched for places that provide fresh produce, fruit as well as beautiful wines or great micro breweries. At home in Santa Barbara there are cultural amenities often are only found in large cities. For those like me who love architecture SB is visual delight with a wealth of outdoor activities to keep us busy: hiking, paddleboarding, cycling, walking, tennis, golfing, polo, sailing, kayaking, swimming or just hanging out at the beach or on the patio reading. Sunshine galore but cools off so nice at night! Fantastic music town too - every genre you can imagine, lots of theaters and music venues.. Art and crafts vendors every Sunday at the beach too!","details":["Response rate: 100%","Response time: within an hour"],"medals":["Identity verified","Superhost"]},"listing":{"id":"c18282a6207e59d74105793d1878bbbd79000f93","title":"Designer's 2 BD Patio Home","street":"117 W Mason St","city":"Santa Barbara","location":"Santa Barbara","listingDescription":"Beautifully renovated patio home featuring open island chef's kitchen, hot tub, 2 bedrooms including a new sleep science King size bed with dual split remotes to raise head or feet, 2 full bathrooms and fabulous community pool on the property.

Awesome for a quick stopover if you are driving the coast. However, if you are an light sleeper, this place will not provide you a solid nights sleep. The walls between units are EXTREMELY thin, and offer no sound attenuation at all. Even the water pipes are extremely noisy, for example, when we were sleeping in Unit 1, our neighbors in Unit 2 arrived around midnight. They then proceeded to turn the water on in their shower (no big deal right?) and it sounded like a waterfall inside of the wall. You can hear everything around you in these units. Conversations, water piping, footsteps, doors closing, everything. The sound is such an issue that upon entering the unit you are greeted by earplugs on your bedside table. The unit is also *somewhat* poorly constructed, the entrance door framing is mid-sized and does not close properly, so the electronic door lock has trouble proplerly closing and locking. We eventually figured out that actually pushing on the door as if to open it while simultaneously hitting the lock button got the job done. Other small construction items were done poorly and seemed to be showing, electrical light switches falling off, no sound insulation in the walls, poor framing, and other small details. Not a huge deal, but small annoyances, especially when trying to get a good nights sleep. The parking was super convenient, dedicated spots right out back. The check in process was super easy and the codes Ziprent provided us worked just fine.

I am a happy resident living in Southern California, which I love. I'm originally from Ohio, attended several universities and received my BA from The Ohio State University, so I AM a huge Buckeye fan, of course! Go Bucks! I had the privilege of traveling to Italy and Spain this past summer for the first time! I enjoyed both of these countries so much, the architect, the ancient history and the ruins mixed with modernism but...Rome simply took my breath away. More about me, I'm a very positive, optimistic and friendly person. I have a sense of humor and I enjoy making people laugh. I also enjoy making people feel at ease, special and loved. I'm also a host of this site and would love to have you as my guest to experience my hospitality in my newly remodeled modern apartment!","details":["Response rate: 100%","Response time: within an hour"],"medals":["Identity verified"]},"listing":{"id":"a6a383003abd00ebe0b950bcb28356abc526d06c","title":"Great Location, Entire studio, Beach & LAX close!","street":"635 Maryland St","city":"El Segundo","location":"El Segundo","listingDescription":"Welcome to El Segundo, California! Enjoy the best of both worlds, the laid back vibe of a small beach community that adjoins the thriving city of Los Angeles. You can walk to the beach, 1/2 mile away & LAX (Los Angeles International Airport) 3 miles away! This adorable community has so many restaurants & shops within walking distance. Whatever you need you can find it in El Segundo & in our neighboring cities of Los Angeles, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach & Redondo Beach!\n\nThe space\nMy place is a studio apartment (no bedroom) and great for one person but it can accommodate two. The sofa pulls out into a full size queen bed. SOME guest have found the BED to be too hard or uncomfortable while others have not. It’s not your traditional mattress bed so be forewarned. I have provided a memory foam mattress to sleep on, if you choose. It’s only 180 square feet so if you’re looking to enjoy a cozy modern studio apartment, this is the place for you!\n\nMy place is located in a commercial/residential building on the second floor. My apartment has been totally remodeled and updated. It’s located in a large brick building that doesn't look like an apartment complex from the outside. The interior of the building is well lit, clean and has carpeted hallways. The second floor houses the living spaces of its tenants. My apartment is located on the second floor at the end of the hallway. During the daytime, you may walk through the main entrance: Go up a flight of stairs, turn right, walk to the end of the hall, turn left and my apartment is at the end on the right side, unit #7.\n\nTo access my apartment, follow these instructions: PLEASE use the back entrance behind the building just around the corner and down the alley. If you're facing the front doors at 202 Grand Ave., entrance, walk to the right, walk down the sidewalk until you reach the STOP sign at the alley. Turn left here, walk a few feet (past the dumpsters) and you'll see the staircase to the left. The STAIRCASE leads up to the second floor & the entrance to my apartment. Walk through the doorway & my apartment is the first door on the left #7. AT NIGHT THE FRONT ENTRANCE OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX IS LOCKED AND REQUIRES A KEY, which I don’t give out. Use the back entrance, it’s more convenient. YOU CAN use the front entrance during the day without a key, if you prefer.\n\nMy door will have an ELECTRONIC Key Pad entry, no key. I will give you the entry code before you arrive. Check in is strictly anytime after 3 pm.\n\nABOUT THE KELESS ENTRY:\nYou will get a 4 digit number to enter. NO KEY is needed for the apartment door, but a key is needed to get into the apartment complex after 6 pm.\n\n1. Enter the 4 digit. Turn the latch and push the door in to open. If you mess up just enter code again.\n\n2. The lock will automatically lock after a few seconds, whether opened or closed.\n\n3. When you leave the apartment make sure that the door is locked after you hear it lock.\n\nCHECKOUT: Promptly at 11 am. If you checkout anytime after 11 am you’re agreeing to pay $25 every 15 minutes. So 11:01- 11:15 is $25. 11:16- 11:30 is another $25 equaling $50 and so forth.\n\nEntering through the door you'll find a brand new everything! The living room is small but cozy. It has a wall mounted drop-leaf table and 2 chairs to enjoy a meal or use as a computer station. Two nesting tables with reversible tops sits in front of the 3 sofas/sleeper sectional seats. There is a custom built wardrobe with 2 doors & 6 drawers. There is also a new AC/Heater. The unit on the wall is BOTH AC (air conditioning) & HEATER. For your viewing pleasure you'll find a new mounted 50-inch Samsung 4K Ultra HD Smart TV with HDR Pro, with full motion swivel articulating arms with tilting. Enjoy watching FREE Netflix as you unwind. There is a kitchenette area equipped with cabinets, a stainless steel sink, counter top microwave, toaster oven, coffee maker and mini refrigerator/freezer. The bathroom is to the right of the kitchenette area. It is small and the door, when closed, leaves very little leg room between the door and the toilet, FYI. You will thoroughly enjoy showering with the new Shower Jet Panel System that has 5 shower settings that your body will absolutely love!! The bathroom floor is also made of a waterproof laminate.\n\nPARKING: There is a lot of available free street parking and some with a two hour limit. You can park longer than two hours in the neighborhood on the side streets. There is a parking structure across the street for the $.99 Store and Goodstuff Restaurant that you can use during the day also but no overnight parking. There’s also two parking lots around the corner on Richmond Ave.\nShow more","locationDescription":"I love El Segundo because it's a small seaside community, laid-back with so much character.

This was extremely uncomfortable, but it got the job done.\n\nThe situation with the light could have been an honest mistake and totally random, or it could show that whoever checks the apartment before the next party checks in isn’t as attentive as they should be.\n\nIn addition, the bed was uncomfortable to sleep on. We used the bedding provided and it still felt like you were laying on 2 by 4’s. However I expected some discomfort considering it’s more of a futon than an actual bed.\n\nAll in all the apartment was “alright” you get what you get for that location and the apartment isn’t exactly marketed as a luxurious stay. You would be hard pressed to find a better rate without compromising on location. I appreciated Wanda as a host and her responsiveness to the situation with the light, although there wasn’t much that could be done to repair the issue during our stay.\n\nIf you’re looking for somewhere with a good location, and you’re willing to compromise on comfort and space, this place is right up your alley (literally)\nShow more"},{"listingId":"a6a383003abd00ebe0b950bcb28356abc526d06c","scores":[["Cleanliness","5.00"],["Accuracy","4.70"],["Communication","5"],["Location","4.90"],["Check-in","5.00"],["Value","4.80"]],"date":"Fri Mar 19 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Awesome and cozy studio.

Thinking about the price offered, the place is really great and the neighborhood is awesomely peaceful and friendly. One thing about the stay here though was the coin operated laundry system (which you have to walk out of the apartment unit and it is at the downstairs at the parking space) that unless you have lot of quarters (7 coins for laundry and 6 for dryer), I find it little troublesome. The quick solution to this is to make a use of Fazio's cleaners which is located about 4 mins away from the apt - but be aware, it takes about 3 days to get your laundry back. So, yes, this is my little tips while I was staying in the area.

The pictures do not represent well the current state of the house. It is more like a busy hostel than a rustic getaway. |||||||\n\nIn terms of dog friendliness, this location is passable. Note that Robert is lenient on his small dogs. He occasionally would stop them when they would come to the room. My medium sized dog is friendly on first greeting but aloof and trained so I would have to escort his dogs out myself most times. |||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\nOverall, staying with Robert was stressful. The following two scenarios surrounding mismatched customer service expectations are my complaints:\n\n( 1 ) Quite shortly after check-in, I was rudely reprimanded when I accidentally left the front gate open . I recommend future guests to take special note of keeping that gate closed.\n\nThe nature of the confrontation was aggressive and irresponsible starting off with my coming back out to the livingroom out of my own room when I heard, \"you can't leave the front gate open, JESUS CHRIST\", through the walls and already closed door. He was able to restate more respectfully when I came out to see what was wrong.\n\nI didn't know that a doggy door was there that would let them out the front, and I was in a rush to get into the room because of the odor coming from the living room. I glossed over the critical nature of his request to keep the front gate closed.\n\nNothing harmed them. His dogs roam freely throughout the house and front yard, I wish this was more explicitly communicated.\n\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n\n(2) When the room across the hallway from mine was cancelled, Robert thought I had cancelled and knocked on my door asking why--\n\nMy lights were already out, and I had to say that he was addressing the wrong person in a different room. Moreover, later that evening, he must have been able to book someone else. He decided to vacuum at 11 pm, and I assume this was to accommodate them, but I was frustrated because this was my second night and I was already a paying guest.\nHis own rules asked us to be quiet after 10 pm. I felt disrespected by this.\n\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\nConclusion:\nCustomer experience wise, this was not the stay I expected.\nThough functionally the location and the proximity to my events fulfilled expectations, and my dog had room enough, the questionable cleanliness combined with the poor check-in experience compelled me to write this review.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"849675a406194f61216dfa41fb9d76a786448066","scores":[["Cleanliness","3.80"],["Accuracy","4.70"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","4.80"],["Check-in","5.00"],["Value","4.60"]],"date":"Sat May 15 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Robert’s space is a nice spot for travelers looking for the basics when on a budget.

The house is much, much more cluttered and dirty than in the photos. Robert is pushing the boundary of being a hoarder both inside the house and outside in the yard/around the house where the back entrance is. Don't expect to be able to use the kitchen for anything other than storing items in the fridge, and the living room is essentially off limits. The bathroom was almost unusable -- I certainly did not feel comfortable with the cleanliness. Robert's products are cluttered all over the countertop and windowsills, and there's dirt and shaving remnants on the countertop, especially near the sink. The trash can is supposed to be automatic, where you wave your hand and it opens, but it doesn't work, so you end up having to pry the top open with your hand (I always used a piece of tissue to do so because the top was always dirty). One good thing is that Robert provides shower shoes -- I wouldn't have used the shower otherwise. The shower itself has dust and cobwebs on the walls and corners of the ceiling. There was hair from other guests on the walls which Robert did not clean off on a daily basis -- I noticed the same hair for days. The room itself wasn't too bad, but definitely cluttered and dusty.\n\nRobert's behavior as a host felt quite unwelcoming as well. The TV was tuned to Fox News 24/7, and there are yard signs that say, \"Defend, Not Defund\" -- so if you're BIPOC or LGBTQ, you probably won't feel comfortable here. Robert has two small dogs, which are very cute, but almost every morning he plays fetch with them inside the house starting at about 7/7:15am. The two bedrooms in his house are on either side of a long hallway, with the bathroom at the end. Robert literally throws a ball down the hallway, and both dogs go running to the end, past both bedrooms, crash into the door at the end of the hallway, then go running back into the living room... back and forth, back and forth, first thing in the morning. Robert has an fenced, outdoor patio in the front so it was unclear to me why he felt the need to play fetch with his dogs in the exact part of his house where guests are staying, at 7am in the morning. Fortunately I left early most days so I was already awake at that time, but on the few days I tried to sleep in, I was woken up by the dogs every morning and couldn't get back to sleep with the noise.\n\nIs this a good value? I think that's a question for you to ask yourself. The price is very, very affordable but you really do get what you pay for here. If uncleanliness and clutter doesn't bother you, then it might be the right fit. But it certainly doesn't look like the photos so buyer beware.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"849675a406194f61216dfa41fb9d76a786448066","scores":[["Cleanliness","3.80"],["Accuracy","4.50"],["Communication","4.70"],["Location","5.00"],["Check-in","5.00"],["Value","4.60"]],"date":"Tue Apr 13 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"5/10"},{"listingId":"849675a406194f61216dfa41fb9d76a786448066","scores":[["Cleanliness","3.80"],["Accuracy","4.50"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","4.80"],["Check-in","5.00"],["Value","4.40"]],"date":"Sat Apr 17 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"I highly advise reading previous reviews on this spot.\n\nI have bug bites on my legs from our stay.
