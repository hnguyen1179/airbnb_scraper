One thing about the stay here though was the coin operated laundry system (which you have to walk out of the apartment unit and it is at the downstairs at the parking space) that unless you have lot of quarters (7 coins for laundry and 6 for dryer), I find it little troublesome. The quick solution to this is to make a use of Fazio's cleaners which is located about 4 mins away from the apt - but be aware, it takes about 3 days to get your laundry back.

The pictures do not represent well the current state of the house. It is more like a busy hostel than a rustic getaway. |||||||\n\nIn terms of dog friendliness, this location is passable. Note that Robert is lenient on his small dogs. He occasionally would stop them when they would come to the room. My medium sized dog is friendly on first greeting but aloof and trained so I would have to escort his dogs out myself most times. |||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\nOverall, staying with Robert was stressful. The following two scenarios surrounding mismatched customer service expectations are my complaints:\n\n( 1 ) Quite shortly after check-in, I was rudely reprimanded when I accidentally left the front gate open . I recommend future guests to take special note of keeping that gate closed.\n\nThe nature of the confrontation was aggressive and irresponsible starting off with my coming back out to the livingroom out of my own room when I heard, \"you can't leave the front gate open, JESUS CHRIST\", through the walls and already closed door. He was able to restate more respectfully when I came out to see what was wrong.\n\nI didn't know that a doggy door was there that would let them out the front, and I was in a rush to get into the room because of the odor coming from the living room. I glossed over the critical nature of his request to keep the front gate closed.\n\nNothing harmed them. His dogs roam freely throughout the house and front yard, I wish this was more explicitly communicated.\n\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n\n(2) When the room across the hallway from mine was cancelled, Robert thought I had cancelled and knocked on my door asking why--\n\nMy lights were already out, and I had to say that he was addressing the wrong person in a different room. Moreover, later that evening, he must have been able to book someone else. He decided to vacuum at 11 pm, and I assume this was to accommodate them, but I was frustrated because this was my second night and I was already a paying guest.\nHis own rules asked us to be quiet after 10 pm. I felt disrespected by this.\n\n|||||||||||||||||||||||||\nConclusion:\nCustomer experience wise, this was not the stay I expected.\nThough functionally the location and the proximity to my events fulfilled expectations, and my dog had room enough, the questionable cleanliness combined with the poor check-in experience compelled me to write this review.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"3a8b8de3398692d34fdd6ed65c26ef15e84857e7","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.90"],["Accuracy","5"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","4.80"],["Check-in","5"],["Value","5.00"]],"date":"Sat Apr 10 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"We really loved our time here, very clean, modern and private.

Unless I’m really bad at directions.. very possible. We had so much fun in Santa Barbara and I would definitely stay here again.

Awesome for a quick stopover if you are driving the coast. However, if you are an light sleeper, this place will not provide you a solid nights sleep.

Even the water pipes are extremely noisy, for example, when we were sleeping in Unit 1, our neighbors in Unit 2 arrived around midnight. They then proceeded to turn the water on in their shower (no big deal right?) and it sounded like a waterfall inside of the wall. You can hear everything around you in these units. Conversations, water piping, footsteps, doors closing, everything. The sound is such an issue that upon entering the unit you are greeted by earplugs on your bedside table. The unit is also *somewhat* poorly constructed, the entrance door framing is mid-sized and does not close properly, so the electronic door lock has trouble proplerly closing and locking. We eventually figured out that actually pushing on the door as if to open it while simultaneously hitting the lock button got the job done. Other small construction items were done poorly and seemed to be showing, electrical light switches falling off, no sound insulation in the walls, poor framing, and other small details. Not a huge deal, but small annoyances, especially when trying to get a good nights sleep. The parking was super convenient, dedicated spots right out back. The check in process was super easy and the codes Ziprent provided us worked just fine. Area seems safe, I would stay here again, but never for more than a day.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"60b17e1212b593e9074783a6cbdb2547f2017ac9","scores":[["Cleanliness","5.00"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","4.80"],["Location","5.00"],["Check-in","4.80"],["Value","4.60"]],"date":"Wed Jun 23 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Great location!

You are steps from the dog beach and people beach. We took our pup on a walk every morning along a wonderful walkway along the water. You are few minutes walk, drive, or scooter ride away from restaurants, bars, shops, Target, live shows, and more! IT WAS AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT LOCATION! Check in/out was easy! Loading and unloading the car was easy when parked in the dog beach lot. Backs right up to the patio! Now, for a few downfalls (but the location made many of these forgivable!) There is no place to relax and watch tv except the bed. You can hear everything from the neighbors on all sides. If you have a “high alert “dog or light sleeper-be prepared. This also means bring your earplugs for the planes flying overhead in the morning. Without AC was just fine- we were quite comfortable- but we also went to target the first day and bought a fan to blow on ourselves when sleeping. There was only the fan in the window in the kitchen. Having to keep the windows open at night also meant that the sun lite place up early in the morning. I recommend a sleep mask! The light on the back porch was a flicker light and made it so you couldn’t really see out there once the sun goes down. But the sound of the ocean was so calming! The weekends are VERY busy and parking on the street was more challenging, but it is in such a good spot that it is assumed the beach parking around it would be full! This location can’t be beat, and many these little things were not that big of a concern.

I was usually able to find parking on the street level, and the surroundings were full of great restaurants. However, when I arrived I noticed that the light switch to the bathroom was broken. It wouldn’t stay on unless you constantly applied pressure to it. Because of this, the other guest and I had to use a reading lamp for light. This was extremely uncomfortable, but it got the job done.\n\nThe situation with the light could have been an honest mistake and totally random, or it could show that whoever checks the apartment before the next party checks in isn’t as attentive as they should be.\n\nIn addition, the bed was uncomfortable to sleep on. We used the bedding provided and it still felt like you were laying on 2 by 4’s. However I expected some discomfort considering it’s more of a futon than an actual bed.\n\nAll in all the apartment was “alright” you get what you get for that location and the apartment isn’t exactly marketed as a luxurious stay. You would be hard pressed to find a better rate without compromising on location. I appreciated Wanda as a host and her responsiveness to the situation with the light, although there wasn’t much that could be done to repair the issue during our stay.\n\nIf you’re looking for somewhere with a good location, and you’re willing to compromise on comfort and space, this place is right up your alley (literally)\nShow more"},{"listingId":"7c8ce2849f07417660462e51461850ac5ed05c4f","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.90"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","5"],["Location","5.00"],["Check-in","4.90"],["Value","4.70"]],"date":"Thu Jul 15 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"awesome."},{"listingId":"b49891e9b0f497b2ef01bf18d6cfbe914cecdee3","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.80"],["Accuracy","5"],["Communication","4.80"],["Location","5.00"],["Check-in","4.90"],["Value","4.90"]],"date":"Thu May 20 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Place is perfect for a family with many options for games.

The AC stopped working for 5 days in 115 degree weather in Las Vegas in the middle of June. I sent the host a text Saturday night. He got back to me at 8am. At 2pm, I hadn't heard back and informed him that my dog was panting and I informed him that we needed to rent a room because we were too uncomfortable. The AC is wireless and he knew how hot it was in the studio because he was texting me the inside temperature and at one point texting \"What are your thoughts? It's 99F in your room. That is definitely too hot.\" He didn't call me until 9pm on Sunday night to inform me that I should get a hotel room and that he would reimburse me because he couldn't get in touch with his ''AC guy.\" I went to the studio to meet his AC guy on a couple of occasions to let him into the studio so that he didn't have my personal entry door code then I'd receive a message from the host saying that his AC guy was unable to make it. This host wouldn't tell me that I should get another room until I had checked out already, so here I go again, single female with a puppy and carrying all our stuff, alone in Vegas, waiting in another long line to check-in. AC did not get fixed until Thursday afternoon and he's trying to charge me utility fees that went above the $30 per month allotment when ONE, I was out of town from May 26th until June 8th and TWO, the AC was running and only blowing hot air for a week, THREE, you need to run the AC when running the dryer (read below on the dryer situation). After submitting receipts and invoices from the hotel stay, I was reimbursed less than 50% of my hotel costs. I checked out last week and still NO REIMBURSEMENT from this host.\n\nALSO, anyone can rent the house that the studio is attached to and depending on whom it is renting, you can here everything from the main house into the studio. One tenant, parked right in front of the studio door, which made it difficult to get in and out of the studio. Another couple fought so much, we could hear everything. Cops were called on a couple of occasions because the woman had hit the man. My daughter was visiting and I was at work and the cops went to speak to my 17 year old daughter about what she heard. After the cops left, the woman staying there went to the studio to apologize to my 17 year old daughter and told her that she's \"sorry\" for the disturbance and that this man that was staying with her has \"been using\" her for 3 years and that she is \"a sex worker.\" This same couple would smoke weed indoors and it would get into the studio through vents, door cracks. I could lose my career being around that. Other issues: There are no outdoor cameras or alarms as stated on the description. There isn't a stove. Only has a microwave, refrigerator, toaster, 5-cup coffee pot, 2 spoons, 2 forks, 2 plates, 2 bowls, etc. The vent to the dryer exhausts into the bathroom instead of outside like its supposed to so the bathroom gets really hot, so hot that I don't think it's safe and the studio can get warm as well, especially if you leave bathroom door open. TV stopped working because the 3-foot antenna fell on the ground and pulled out the cable input that is in the back of the television and there was no rush to fix it. The host isn't even local. He told me he lives in California and travels to other states as well for work. There is a park across the street with a lot of homeless people who walk up and down the street or hang out at the park. There are also soccer fields at that park, which can get loud too on game nights due to loud music, cars revving and peeling out at the end of the game.\n\nI have documented all communication between me and this host.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"3a8b8de3398692d34fdd6ed65c26ef15e84857e7","scores":[["Cleanliness","5"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","5"],["Location","4.80"],["Check-in","5"],["Value","4.80"]],"date":"Tue Jun 29 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Best airbnb we've stayed at.

I would have given this place 5 stars but for a couple of things which I will address further down. First, the good - the location is amazing. You are literally right across from the beach and right next to the dog beach. For the price, you really can't beat that. The description and photos were pretty accurate as well. The place was clean upon arrival, and it had everything I needed for the week that I was there. In addition, Natalia responded to any questions I had within a matter of 10 to 20 minutes. I know some people have made comments about the neighbors in the building - I didn't have any issues with them. The ones I encountered were friendly and nice. I think you just have to remember that they live there and the building is their home. Respect that and they will respect you. Also, I did not have any issues finding parking. A couple of times I had to circle, but ultimately found parking nearby.\nThe not so great - the bed. It was beyond uncomfortable and it was probably one of the worst mattresses I have ever slept on. Honestly, if not for the bed I would have given this place 5 stars. I stayed there for a week - if I had only been staying a couple of days, maybe it would have been more tolerable, but by midweek I was actually dreading going to bed at night because it was so uncomfortable. For the price and location, if the mattress was replaced this place would be perfect. The only other negative was that part of the fence in the back was broken. One of the wood panels was broken almost in half, so people in the park can literally see right in to the apartment.\nOverall, it was a good stay. Like I said, the only reason for the 3 stars is because of the bed, which for me is huge when I am staying somewhere for a week.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"068e0949598ba2d9d8e5232920c8d22e6908d399","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.80"],["Accuracy","5"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","5"],["Check-in","5.00"],["Value","4.70"]],"date":"Tue Jul 06 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"You won't be disappointed, the beds are all foam mattresses and very comfortable.

And if you want to not sweat at night and leave the sliding glass door open your going to get woken up by the fighting and the smell of smoke from the beach firepits.

The set up of the whole backyard was amazing even to the smallest detail decor. When searching for a place for our week long stay, we were for sure set on the place having a pool. We came across John's place and loved the pics alone. Prior to our arrival, John reached out and extended an invite to book with him to tour the HooverDam/Lake Mead on his boat. Even from the brief conversation prior to our stay, John was very welcoming. Upon our arrival, John was quick with responding to us with check in instructions. Walking into the Oasis, we were taken away from how big the backyard actually was compared to the pictures. We questioned ourselves to whether or not we actually had access to the whole backyard, there was so much space. The energy walking into the unit was great! So well kept, nice, clean and just so welcoming. The unit also was bigger than we expected from the photos. The pool was calling us every day (not only from the heat but from the beautiful set up). The Koi pond was so relaxing. Sitting on the swinging bench, listening to the waterfall and admiring the decor was an everyday mandatory task by choice. John was great with communicating with us whenever we needed anything. Such great energy.\nWe definitely recommend his unit and we DEFINITELY plan on booking with him again! I can not wait to plan another trip to Vegas. Although this was our first time staying so far from the strip while in Vegas, it was well worth the 20 minute drive.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"03029b6cb26c22b17f75e9cb96237d1ab434517d","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.70"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","4.90"],["Check-in","5"],["Value","5.00"]],"date":"Fri Apr 09 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Very cute and comfy.

This location is close to hot spots like Santa Monica, Malibu, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and Downtown Los Angeles (though having a car helps to see these places since the Metro isn’t as convenient). This particular place is nearby a studio, coffee shops, and other places of convenience. Robert is a super friendly host.\n\nThe place has a homey, comfortable feel and Robert has told me he built the house that is outside in the backyard. Notably, I had an important interview early morning through Zoom and was outside, but Robert was kind enough to leave that area for my interview. I absolutely adored the spaniel and mutt. Included amenities during my stay were wifi, kitchen access, and there were plenty of parking on the streets. I brought a lot of my own stuff such as a bath towel and takeout, so I had no need to use a lot of the amenities nor the kitchen, though it feels nice to know you are covered when in the case you don’t bring your necessary belongings. I stayed here for almost a week and felt safe. You get what you pay for here. Looking at other reviews, remember that Airbnb is not a hotel, motel, or hostel. You are paying for experiences the host offers at their best. Otherwise, go to aforementioned and not Airbnb.

The house is much, much more cluttered and dirty than in the photos. Robert is pushing the boundary of being a hoarder both inside the house and outside in the yard/around the house where the back entrance is. Don't expect to be able to use the kitchen for anything other than storing items in the fridge, and the living room is essentially off limits. The bathroom was almost unusable -- I certainly did not feel comfortable with the cleanliness. Robert's products are cluttered all over the countertop and windowsills, and there's dirt and shaving remnants on the countertop, especially near the sink. The trash can is supposed to be automatic, where you wave your hand and it opens, but it doesn't work, so you end up having to pry the top open with your hand (I always used a piece of tissue to do so because the top was always dirty). One good thing is that Robert provides shower shoes -- I wouldn't have used the shower otherwise. The shower itself has dust and cobwebs on the walls and corners of the ceiling. There was hair from other guests on the walls which Robert did not clean off on a daily basis -- I noticed the same hair for days. The room itself wasn't too bad, but definitely cluttered and dusty.\n\nRobert's behavior as a host felt quite unwelcoming as well. The TV was tuned to Fox News 24/7, and there are yard signs that say, \"Defend, Not Defund\" -- so if you're BIPOC or LGBTQ, you probably won't feel comfortable here. Robert has two small dogs, which are very cute, but almost every morning he plays fetch with them inside the house starting at about 7/7:15am. The two bedrooms in his house are on either side of a long hallway, with the bathroom at the end. Robert literally throws a ball down the hallway, and both dogs go running to the end, past both bedrooms, crash into the door at the end of the hallway, then go running back into the living room... back and forth, back and forth, first thing in the morning. Robert has an fenced, outdoor patio in the front so it was unclear to me why he felt the need to play fetch with his dogs in the exact part of his house where guests are staying, at 7am in the morning. Fortunately I left early most days so I was already awake at that time, but on the few days I tried to sleep in, I was woken up by the dogs every morning and couldn't get back to sleep with the noise.\n\nIs this a good value? I think that's a question for you to ask yourself. The price is very, very affordable but you really do get what you pay for here. If uncleanliness and clutter doesn't bother you, then it might be the right fit. But it certainly doesn't look like the photos so buyer beware.\nShow more"},{"listingId":"e1e436a683227ef702c611435d8693c38c1997d1","scores":[["Cleanliness","5.00"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","5.00"],["Location","4.90"],["Check-in","5"],["Value","5.00"]],"date":"Tue Mar 23 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"The place was great for me, very clean Also had Netflix and direct TV which I really appreciated.

Had I paid less, this would be a completely different review. \n\nIt absolutely is RIGHT on the beach as advertised, but it should be mentioned that the apartment complex is very run down. I wouldn't say the apartment was dirty necessarily, but some things were definitely grimy- the liquid-stained front door, food-stained artwork above the kitchen sink, the hairs above the shower, the wobbly toilet, the amount of gnats and giant houseflies inside the unit. There arent really amenities- no toiletries aside from a single bottle of body wash, no condiments, and most importantly- no A/C, making our 85°, 90% humidity stay a VERY loud, sticky night. However I did really appreciate the filtering water pitcher and sunscreen!\n\nThere's clearly some weird friction with the neighbors, considering the passive aggressive signs in the cars in the driveway and all the notes around the unit to be quiet, which I don't understand. We were greeted by like three different dogs barking every time we walked in or out, and sitting in the patio or leaving the windows open (a must with no A/C) meant listening to every footstep and word of the upstairs neighbor and hearing every single car, dog, and airplane that passes by starting at 5AM. There are two small fans, one of them broken and only able to face the ceiling, and the other being a window fan, meaning you have to leave the blinds open to use it... Allowing all the neighbors a direct view to the bed.\n\n\nThe biggest redeeming quality would be the location, but ultimately this ended up being a drawback for us due to the noise of massive crowds and dogs in the PACKED beach parking lot (I'm talking like 300+ cars on a random Wednesday) just outside your window and ridiculous lack of parking. That being said, if you are really looking to spend all day at the beach with your dog- this place is probably perfect for you.... Though I personally wouldn't spend the same nightly rate that'd get you a decent hotel room with some privacy, quiet, and air conditioning. \n\nAll that being said, a simple price adjustment or even just a small portable AC unit could easily make this a four star experience. \nShow more"},{"listingId":"3bc4aadb097f9300b3ae9d01725aab6150bfad54","scores":[["Cleanliness","4.80"],["Accuracy","4.90"],["Communication","5"],["Location","4.80"],["Check-in","4.90"],["Value","5.00"]],"date":"Sat Jul 17 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"The cabin is beautiful - the decor and use of space are thoughtful and stunning!

We were up here for a few days, and we loved our time spent in this cabin. If it's available the next time we make the trek up the mountains, we will definitely be booking this same place.\nLet's talk a few details that are relevant to choosing this place by Bearadise.\nLOCATION: It's just a couple minutes from the Stanfield Cutoff. This means you're in a great position to visit either the north or south shores easily. Really close to the Alpine Pedal Path, which runs from the Stanfield Marsh to the Observatory, and is a really nice ride if you get the chance.\nAMENITIES: You're in the mountains! You have the necessities - showers, great beds, cooking pans, and flatware/cutlery. There's not much need for air conditioning. We were there during the hottest days of the summer, and opening the windows at night meant the place was really quite cool. (Yes, a little warm in the heat of the day *upstairs*, but it stayed comfortable downstairs the entire time.) There is also a tv upstairs and downstairs, if that's what you need.\nMANAGEMENT: The entire time of our stay, the owners were very prompt and polite during our conversations. They consistently checked on our stay, and wanted to make sure everything was at its absolute best. With people like this working behind the scenes, you're assured a pleasant stay.\nLike I said, we loved our short stay here, and we hope many others get the opportunity to enjoy it as well. ☺\nShow more"},{"listingId":"d4134c510e75cef01dd2e535ff85f433501312c5","scores":[["Cleanliness","5.00"],["Accuracy","5"],["Communication","4.90"],["Location","4.90"],["Check-in","5"],["Value","5.00"]],"date":"Tue Jun 15 2021 00:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)","content":"Joe's place has everything you need for your getaway stay.
